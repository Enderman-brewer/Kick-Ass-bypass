The original has you put this in your bookmarks bar and click it on the website you want to play your game
```
javascript:var KICKASSVERSION='2.0';var s = document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='//hi.kickassapp.com/kickass.js';void(0);
```

But the issue is that `hi.kickassapp.com/kickass.js` is not available everywhere like public networks, so I have created a bypass by putting the whole script in the bookmmarklet.
Here's how you do it:
1. Paste the contents of [kickass.js](/kickass.js) to [this site using default settings](https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/)
2. Create the bookmarklet and put it in your bookmarks bar
3. Go to any website
4. Click the bookmark
5. Break the site with `up`, `left`, `right` and `space`
6. Press `ESC` to deload the game, or refresh the site to revert to original site.
