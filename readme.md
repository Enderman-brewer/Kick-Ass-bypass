The original has you put this in your bookmarks bar and click it on the website you want to play your game
```
javascript:var KICKASSVERSION='2.0';var s = document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';document.body.appendChild(s);s.src='//hi.kickassapp.com/kickass.js';void(0);
```

But the issue is that `hi.kickassapp.com/kickass.js` is not available everywhere like public networks, so I'm working on a bypass.
